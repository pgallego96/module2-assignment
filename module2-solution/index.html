		The webpage has been structured in accordance with the criteria outlined in the <a href="https://github.com/jhu-ep-coursera/fullstack-course4/blob/master/assignments/assignment2/Assignment-2.md" target = "_blank">Assignment 2</a> GitHub page. It contains three separate boxes acting as container, with individual subtitles which are used to differentiate each of them. The HTML file has no styling attributes, the styling is all done separately within the CSS file allocated in the required folder.

		The colours for this webpage have been derived from a website called <a href="https://colorbrewer2.org/" target="_blank">Color Brewer 2</a> which I have previously used in styling visual designs. These colours generally are quite pleasing, and it gives the option of selecting colour blind styling as well. I decided to space out the subtitle section as well as I thought it was more pleasing.
